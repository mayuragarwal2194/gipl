          "These are made and engineered to achieve extremely low strain and powerful tensile strengths of up to 300kN/M. A netting panel with rhomboidal holes is wrapped with a single continuous length of steel wire rope that is 8â€“10 mm in diameter and has a tensile strength of 1770 N/mm2. Typically, the holes are 300 mm by 300 mm. Each side of the rectangular netting panel is often 4-6 meters long.",
