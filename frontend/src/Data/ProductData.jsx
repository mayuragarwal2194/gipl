With a braking mechanism, steel supports, and high-strength wire mesh or rings, they can withstand impacts up to 5,000 kJ. These barriers are made to flex and disperse energy, keeping debris safely contained while adjusting to any type of terrain. For rockfall protection, they are the sensible option since they are long-lasting, simple to install, and ideal for both high- and low-energy occurrences."

                  "Geo-composite Geomat are polypropylene erosion control panels reinforced with double-twisted steel wire mesh that is placed into the structure during production. It is intended for the protection and growth of grass on slopes prone to surface erosion. GTI Geo-composite Geomats are three-dimensional mats made of black polypropylene yarn matted together using an extension method that incorporates DT wire mesh into the mat. The three-dimensional structure is specifically designed to trap a layer of topsoil, preventing rainwater erosion by both shielding the surface from the force of raindrops and restricting the movement of soil particles. The DT mesh offered tensile strength to the mat, making it more durable to install."
